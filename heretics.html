                        These are the heretics. Those who have strayed from the pack, those who have strayed from the
                        good graces of Father Wolf and Mother Luna. Those who have in turn falleb from the good graces
                        of the Spirit Claw tribe. Do not associate with them. Do not talk to them. Do not help them in
                        any way lest you be accused of being in league with them. If you are aware of their presence and
                        not fighting against them then you are negative contracting with them. You are dishonoring
                        Father Wolf and Mother Luna as well.

                    <p>
                        When you see these wolfs it is an S.O.S. - smash on sight.

                    <p>
                        This Lycan has forsaken and disavowed Father Wolf and Mother Luna by taking a vow with unclean
                        spirits for gifts that make him very powerful. For one, he can shift his whole being into
                        inanimate objects and only certain parts of his body as well, which can make him hard to locate
                        at times. We
                        are not sure when those powers of his go into effect, but they are cyclical like the different
                        shitfs of a werewolf. He must be brought to the Spirit Claw tribe for justice. If necessary,
                        kill him. You will not be judged.

                    <p>
                        Discordio must be turned over to the Spirit Claw tribe for judgment. In his over reaching
                        advances to become an alpha wolf when he shifts, he has tried to over throw every established
                        form of order that Father Wolf and Mother Luna has put in place for their lycans. Bring him to
                        the Spirit Claw tribe. Alive preferrably.

            The authority of the words of the elders of the spirit tribe come
            from the spirt of Father Wolf and Mother Luna.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the spirit world, Father Wolf and Mother Luna came together and
            seen that there was a need to balance some of the spirit influence
            in the world that they did not feel was good.
          </p>
          <p>
            To counterbalance the negative influence of certain spirits, Lycans
            were given gifts to use for these purposes. Lycans were given the
            benefits of the speed, strength, ferocity and heightened senses. And
            mother Luna blessed us with the ability to shift and change as does
            the phases of the moon.
          </p>
          <p>
            Father Wolf and Mother Luna blessed the Spirit Claw tribe with a
            direct line of communication through their shamans and seers. They
            are to give wisdom and direction to all that have been blessed Lycan
            gifts. It the will of Father Wolf and Mother Luna for the entire
            Lycan community to listen and follow their directives. The elders of
            the Spirit Claw tribe shall rule the Lycans.
